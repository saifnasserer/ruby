**1. Make the complex simple**

Your job is to turn something scientific and intimidating (HRV, wearables, AI) into something human.

- Don’t overload therapists with numbers.
- Give them clear states: *calm, stressed, recovering*.
- Keep raw data in the background for those who want it.

**2. Design is how it works**

AI and wearables should feel like *magic*, not technology.

- The AI chat should feel like a colleague, not a robot.
- Wearables should feel like a bridge to the body, not a gadget.
- The therapist should feel supported, not overwhelmed.

**3. Create emotional connection**

You’re not showing data; you’re creating *emotion*.

- Progress should feel encouraging.
- Negative states should offer guidance, not fear.
- Design must breathe calm: soft colors, clean typography, minimal clutter.

**4. Focus on experience**

Every screen should answer: *“What does this give me right now?”*

- Therapist: is this technique working?
- Client: how do I feel, and what can I do?
- Both: the AI assistant as a *friend*.

**5. Details matter**

- AI should “pause to think” → feels human.
- Wearable integration → one click, no setup.
- Reports → beautiful, minimalist, Apple-like.

**6. Bridge fear and trust**

Therapists may fear machines replacing humans. Clients may fear confronting data.

- Always emphasize: **the human is in charge**.
- Technology is the supportive background.

## 🖼️ Moodboard Directions

- **Style:** Apple minimalism (clean layouts, lots of whitespace, simple but elegant typography like SF Pro or Inter).
- **Imagery:** abstract waves, soft gradients, biometrics rendered as *living elements* (not cold graphs).
- **Icons:** line-based, rounded corners, lightweight.
- **Motion:** smooth micro-animations (gentle fades, subtle breathing effect for calm).
- **AI Chat:** designed as a *conversation with care* → like iMessage but warmer, with thoughtful spacing and soft colors.
- **Reports:** not tables, but cards with short insights, supported by icons/emojis.
